# Welcome!

Hey there! This is my personal portfolio, and it’s all yours to explore. Fork it, clone it, and play around with it, make it your own!

You can start by customizing [`about.ts`](src/core/config/about.ts) to add your info, then tweak the rest of the site however you like. Tinker, experiment, and create a website that’s uniquely you. I hope you have as much fun building it as I did!
