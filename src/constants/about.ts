  title: "Fullstack AI Engineer",
  bio: `
  I'm a software developer and graduate student at Rutgers University, graduating in December 2025. I specialize in full-stack engineering, distributed systems, and AI-driven tools. With 4+ years of professional experience at Zoho Corporation and academic projects spanning systems to LLMs, I bring industry-proven engineering and curiosity-driven research together.

  Some highlights:
    - Migrated a legacy SNMP framework to C++ with a 39x performance boost
    - Built distributed schedulers, RPC wrappers, and rollback systems for production
    - Developed a cloud storage platform with AI-powered semantic search (Redis AI Challenge)
    - Created lightweight frontend apps like Emoji Diary and a retro Pok√©dex-themed portfolio
    - Designed and taught undergraduate CS courses covering systems, networking, and AI fundamentals

  I'm actively seeking Fulltime Software Engineering Spring 2026 opportunities in full-stack, systems, or AI development, where I can design efficient systems and build intelligent, user-focused products.
