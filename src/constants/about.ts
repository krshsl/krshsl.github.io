  bio: `
  I‚Äôm a software developer and graduate student at Rutgers University, graduating in December 2025. I specialize in backend systems, distributed architectures, and AI-driven tools. With 4+ years of professional experience at Zoho Corporation and hands-on academic research, I bring a mix of industry-tested engineering and curiosity-driven exploration.

  Some of my highlights:
  - Rewrote a legacy SNMP framework in C++ for a 39x performance boost
  - Built distributed schedulers, secure RPC wrappers, and rollback systems for production environments
  - Fine-tuned LLMs to translate SQL queries into natural language with 95% accuracy
  - Designed and taught undergraduate CS courses covering systems, networking, and AI

  I‚Äôm currently looking for full-time SDE roles starting Spring 2026. My focus is on roles where I can design efficient systems, solve hard problems, and help shape products from the ground up.
